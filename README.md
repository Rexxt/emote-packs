# emote-packs
emote packs you can use (with credit of course)

everything except `misc/` is original content made by me, [azi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzUMzaSaLUZtPpOpNRwCG_w), ばかです or whoever skinned the original NotITG theme.

Current emote packs:
# [cats](cats/)
cropped pictures of my cats
# [splatoon](splatoon/)
gay little squid game
# [misc](misc/)/[animated](misc/#animated)
random emotes that are cool
